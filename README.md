# CZ4071 Network Science Project 2
CZ4071: PRODIGE - Beyond Vector Spaces - Compact Data Representation as Differentiable Weighted Graphs

## Setup
Ubuntu 18.04, Python >= 3.6.9 (tested on Windows, via Windows Subsystem for Linux)

### Instructions
1. Install dependencies in 'requirement.txt'
2. Run 'jupyter notebook' in command line
3. Access 'toy_datasets.ipynb' jupyter notebook
4. Choose 1 out of the 3 datasets to run (MNIST, IRIS or WINE) and run all the cells below. This should around 10-20mins
5. PRODIGE graph visualization will be automatically saved as 'visual.html' in the same directory.
6. Not recommended to run 'real_datasets.ipynb', as it will take many hours and huge memory resources. Please look at the report for our results on real-world datasets.
